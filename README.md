Skeleton project for Genesis Application. This project has been created from the Genesis Blank Application Seed. Our seeds allow users to quickly bootstrap
their projects. Each seed adheres to strict Genesis best practices, and has passed numerous performance, compliance and
accessibility checks. All seeds are built using only the Genesis Components they require. Please note seeds may contain
a number of client and server tech variants. However, only the variant combination selected by you (the developer) will
remain after project initialisation. If you need to reference the original code please follow the instructions below.

# Introduction

## Servers

Seeds may provide one or more server variants for you (the developer) to chose from during project initialisation, ie.
jvm, python etc. Only the variant you choose will be present in your repo, however you can review all the original
reference code in the upstream origin if needed.

### JVM

The jvm server variant for this project can be found [here](./server/jvm/README.md).
It is built using a DSL-like definition based on the Kotlin language: GPAL.

## Clients

Seeds may provide one or more clients, ie. web, mobile, desktop etc.

### Web Client

The web client for this project can be found [here](./client/web/README.md). It is built using Genesis's next
generation web development framework, which is based on Web Components. Our state-of-the-art design system and component
set is built on top of [Microsoft FAST](https://www.fast.design/docs/introduction/).
